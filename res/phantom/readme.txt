* How to use this model *

Extract this archive into your Quake2 directory.  It has it's own
internal directory structure in an attempt to make sure everyone has it
in the same location, and so the weapon skin shows up properly (it's
tied into the directory name somehow).  Whatever happens, the intention
is that the model will be installed into the following path:

    <quake2 dir>\baseq2\players\phantom
eg:
    c:\quake2\baseq2\players\phantom
